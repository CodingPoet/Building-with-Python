# Product Microsite

Introduction here




## Requirements

Each of these requirements must be met in order for the project to be considered complete:

- The site should be restricted to a single page.

- The name of the product must feature prominently on the page.

- There must be at least 3 photographs featuring the product. At least one must be of the product in use and at least one must be of the product by itself.

- There must be a list of relevant technical specifications.

- The page must include information about where the product may be purchased.

- All HTML must be valid HTML5

- All CSS must be valid CSS3 and be stored in an external stylesheet.




## Things to Consider

- The theme of the site should suit the product's target audience.

- The most important information should be most visible, and the less important information should be secondary.

- Purchase information may just be a list of retailers, but how could you make the list most useful to the potential buyer?




## Extra Challenges

Once you've completed your web page and fulfilled all requirements, have a go at some of these extra challenges:

- **Beginner:** Use a custom font from [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com) for all the headings on your page.

- **Intermediate:** Add a jQuery slideshow featuring some of the best product photos.
