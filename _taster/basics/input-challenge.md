## Input Challenge

Using the following starter code

	greeting = "Hello!"
	introduction = "My name is"
	luckyNumberText = "My lucky number is"
	
	# missing code goes here

	print(greeting)
	print(introduction, name)
	print(luckyNumberText, luckyNumber)

See if you can modify the code to:

- ask you for your name and lucky number
- use those values in the message
