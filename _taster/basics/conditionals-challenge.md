## Conditionals Challenge

Using the following starter code:

	chosenNumber = input("Please enter a number between 1 and 10: ")
	chosenNumber = int(chosenNumber)

	# if less than one
	print("Too low!")

	# else if more than 10
	print("Too high!")

	# else
	print("Perfect! Thank you.")

Change the code to output the correct response,<br>
based on the user's input.

Make sure to check the boundary values (0, 1, 10, and 11)
