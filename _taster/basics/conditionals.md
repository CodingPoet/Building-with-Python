## Conditionals

	password = input("Please enter your password: ")

	if password == "bunnies":
		print("Success!")
	else:
		print("Access Denied")

If-else statements allow us to choose which piece of code to run, based on a value.

This is "Boolean logic" where a result is always either true or false.
