Some of the events happening in NZ around Python.





## Meetup Groups

### [NZ Python User Group](http://www.meetup.com/nz-python-user-group)
Monthly User Group meetups occur in most major cities in NZ.





## Conferences

### [Kiwi PyCon](http://nz.pycon.org/)
This annual conference is run by the NZ Python User Group.



## Forums

### [NZ Python Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nzpug)
Fairly active forum for discussion of all things Python-related.




## Competitions

### [NCSS Challenge](https://groklearning.com/challenge/)

The Challenge is a programming competition for secondary school students which runs once each year. It’s been running in Australia for the last 9 years, and it's now open to everyone - even here in New Zealand!

The Challenge is unlike any other programming competition. They teach you how to program as the competition goes along, rather than expecting you to be an expert already. If you’re a seasoned coder, there's something for you too – the problems range from relatively simple to mind-bendingly hard.



## Other Cool Stuff

Coming soon.
