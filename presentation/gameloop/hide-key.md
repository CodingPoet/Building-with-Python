### Hide Key

In cellar.py:

    # create all the items you can interact with in the room
    self.items = [
        Item("k", "Key")
    ]

Note:
Just finding your way to a room is a bit easy. Let's put a lock on the door.

This is what our `items` array is for in each of our room classes.

I'm going to hide my key in the cellar.
