### Other Rooms

Note:
Now would be an ideal time to create and test all the other rooms we want to use in our game.

For every room in the game:

 - Import the new room at the top of your main adventureworld file.

 - Add the room to the rooms dictionary

 - Test that the room has been set up correctly by entering that room as the first room of the game.

Once you've tested that every room is printing out the correct information, we can move on to the next step!
