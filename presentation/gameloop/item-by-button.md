### Item By Button

	# try to find a door associated with that key
	chosenDoor = room.getDoorByButton(buttonPressed)
		
	# try to find an item associated with that key
	chosenItem = room.getItemByButton(buttonPressed)

Note:
And just as we look up doors by the button the user pressed, we can look up items too.
