### Hello World
_Using the print() function_

Note:
Run your first script by double clicking the "Run Python File" button on the right side of your screen.

The words "Hello World" should show up in a special area at the bottom of your Komodo window.

Got that working? Excellent!

Now try changing the message to say hello to you, using your name.
