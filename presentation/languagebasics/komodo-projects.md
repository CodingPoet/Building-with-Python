### Komodo

Note:
To work through these examples, we are going to open up the whole folder in Komodo so that we can see all the files at the same time.

Although we will be able to see all the files at once, we are going to run each one individually. 

Open Komodo, create a new project... select the folder called "Snippets" and click the "Open" button. You should see a list of all the snippets down the left-hand side of your Komodo window.
