### Komodo Projects

1. Open Komodo
2. Create a new project
3. Select folder "Snippets"
4. Click "Open"

Note:
A Komodo project is just a folder with a bunch of files inside. We're going to open up our Snippets folder as a Project, which will allow us to see all the files at once.

Although we will be able to see all the files at once, we are going to run each one individually. 

Open Komodo, create a new project... select the folder called "Snippets" and click the "Open" button. You should see a list of all the snippets down the left-hand side of your Komodo window.
