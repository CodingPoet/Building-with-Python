### Running Scripts

- Go to Tools > Run Command... 
- Enter %(python) -u %F
- Tick "Add to toolbox"
- Done!

Note:
Open the first file, `00-hello-world.py` 

This is our good friend the `print` function. We'll be using print a lot in our text-based Python programs, because it's how we make words appear the screen.

To run the file, we'll set up an action. Go to Tools > Run Command... and enter `%(python) -u %F`
