### Running Scripts

Note:
Click on the first file, the one starting with a zero. 

This is our good friend the `print` function. We'll be using print a lot in our text-based Python programs, because it's how we make words appear the screen.

To run the file, we'll set up an action. Go to Tools > Run Command... and enter `%(python) -u %F`
