### Loops

Example of a loop:

    print("Here are the seven times tables:")

    for number in range(1, 6):
        result = 7 * number
        print(result)

And its output:

    7
    14
    21
    28
    35

Note:
Loops allow you to run the same piece of code many times in a row.

Instead of writing a similar piece of code over and over many times, we can put that code inside a loop and then tell the loop how many times to run it.
