### Play with loops

    for number in range(1, 6):
        print(number)

Note:
Open up the file `03-loops.py` and run the program to see the output.

See if you can change the code so that it prints out multiples of 10 instead.

Can you change the loop to count from 0 to 100 in steps of 10?

How about steps of 5?
