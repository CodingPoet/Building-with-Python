### Conditional Examples

Basic "if" statement

	if score > 1000:
		print("You won a gold trophy!")


An "if-else" statement

	if score > 1000:
		print("You won a gold trophy!")
	else:
		print("Sorry, you didn't win a trophy")


Note:
By using conditionals, we are able to choose different pathways through our code. We can choose the pathway we want based on the current state of the program, or based on input from the user.

You may want to have functionality like _"if the score is higher than 1000, then give the user a gold trophy"_, or maybe _"if the user clicked the start button, then start the game"_.

Conditionals can also have multiple levels, so that if the test value is false, we can still do something else instead.

We can even test multiple values!
