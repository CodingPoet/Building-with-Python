### Variable examples

Number variables

	kittens = 5
	bunnies = 8
	frogs = 3

	fluffyAnimals = kittens + bunnies

String variables

	summaryMessage = "Number of fluffy animals: "

	print( summaryMessage + fluffyAnimals )

Note:
Variables can be given an exact value, or they can have their value made up of combinations of other variables.

Numbers are just typed in as the exact number that you want.

Words or sentences need to be wrapped in quotation marks, so the computer knows that the words are all related even though there are spaces between them.

Variable names don't need quotation marks, even though they look like words. This is because the computer knows they are a storage place for other values, and are not a value themselves.

We can even add together text and numbers. Crazy!
