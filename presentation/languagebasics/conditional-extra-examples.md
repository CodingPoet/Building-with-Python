### Conditionals More Examples

If the user entered the right password, they can log in:

	if enteredPassword == "bAnAn@s":
		print("Correct! You may log in.")
    else:
        print("Sorry, wrong password")

Both of the conditionals below actually do the same thing:

    if userHasPaid == false:
        print("Sorry, you need to pay first.")
    else:
        print("Thanks for paying! Go on through.")

&nbsp;

    if userHasPaid == true:
        print("Thanks for paying! Go on through.")
    else:
        print("Sorry, you need to pay first.")


Note:
The boolean tests used with conditional statements can be made up many different ways.

You could test whether one piece of text is the same an another, or whether a user has already completed a certain task.

You can also compare numbers like we did earlier, to see whether a value is larger than, smaller than, or equal to a number you provide.
