### Rooms

Note:
Our game is going to be structured around a series of rooms. The player will move between those rooms via doors.

Open up the file `alleyway.py` in the `rooms` folder.

This is what we call a `class`. A `class` is usually created to represent an object of some kind. It contains variables and functions which are related to that object.

The `Alleyway` class contains all the information we need about the Alleyway, which is the first "room" our player will enter.
