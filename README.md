# Building with Python

This project is a full website containing presentation slides, workbook and extra projects for beginner programmers interested in learning Python.

The site is designed to be used alongside a workshop deliverd by the Gather Workshops team, but can also be used and explored by anyone without the need for a workshop.

You can view the live site [here](http://nzgather.github.io/Building-with-Python).
