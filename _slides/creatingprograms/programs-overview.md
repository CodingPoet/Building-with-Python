  What we have been doing so far is working with "Python scripts".

  Scripts are usually just a single file, and solve a problem in a fairly linear fashion.

  A more complex Python program may pull together many different pieces of code from different files, each with a different purpose.

  A Python program could be a website, a desktop application, or a command line program. We will be building a command line program.
