  Komodo Edit is what we call an IDE, which stands for Intergated Development Environment.

  All that means is it's a place to write your code, and a place to run it.

  You may have used other code editors like Notepad++ or IDLE. Komodo is much the same, but a bit prettier. It is cross-platform, and it's free.

  To work through these examples, we are going to open up the whole folder in Komodo so that we can see all the files at the same time.
