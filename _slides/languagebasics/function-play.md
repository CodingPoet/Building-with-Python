  **Challenges:**

  - Make another function called `sayGoodbye` and have it print an appropriate message.

  - Call the `sayHello` and `sayGoodbye` functions one after the other.

  - Change the `multiplyByTwo` function to `multiplyByTen` and update the code so it correctly multiplies by 10.

### Playing with Functions

Said hello? Now say goodbye!

See if you can multiply by ten instead of two.
