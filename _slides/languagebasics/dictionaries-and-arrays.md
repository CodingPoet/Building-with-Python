  Dictionaries are associative structures. They associate one value with another.

  An example of this would be looking up information on a person using their name.

  Arrays are non-associative. They are just collections of pieces of data which are related to each other.

  Arrays may be ordered, eg. from lowest value to highest, or alphabetically.

  Dictionaries are not ordered as they have no need to be. You reference values by name, not by their location in the data set.

### Dictionaries and Arrays

_store sets of related data values_

Dictionaries let us look things up by their name.

Arrays let us look things up by their position in the array.
