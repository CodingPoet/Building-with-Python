  Now, calling the `enterRoom` function and passing it the name of the room to enter should print out all the information for the given room.

  Call the `enterRoom` function to enter the Alleyway immediately after the introduction has been printed.

  Run your game to check that it still works the same as before, despite the code rearrangement!
