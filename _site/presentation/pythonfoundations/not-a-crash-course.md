### Not a crash course

Making cool stuff

Note:
This workshop is not a crash course in Python, in that we don't cover a lot of depth or theory. Instead we cover a broad range of concepts with a goal in mind of an application you can actually take home at the end and show off to people.

Our hope is that you will feel comfortable enough with the code you have written during this course to be able to go away and expand on it, continue learning, continue tinkering, and even feel confident introducing others to it.

Most of all we want you to have fun. If you're struggling, ask for help. Programming is about making cool stuff, and that's what we are all here for. To learn how to make cool stuff.
