### _A Whirlwind Tour of Strings, Variables and Loops_




Note:
Without further ado, let's get to some actual coding.

The code snippets we will be working with are available from the link on this slide. If you downloaded them to a USB stick earlier, they'll be in the Snippets folder.

Starting out with Python is as simple as writing a line of code in a plain text file with a .py extension, and then running that file in Python.

To work through these examples, we are going to open up the whole folder in Komodo so that we can see all the files at the same time, but we are just going to run each one individually. 

Open Komodo, create a new project... select the folder called "Snippets" and click the "Open" button. You should see a list of all the snippets down the left-hand side of your Komodo window.

Click on the first one, starting with a zero. You should see the following code. Everyone got that? This is our good friend the Print function. We'll be using print a lot in text-based applications, because it's how we output text to the screen.

To run the file, we'll set up an action. Tools > Run Command... enter %(python) -u %F.
