### Loop Examples

Exact number of times:

    for number in range(1, 6):
        print(number)


Once for each array item:

    for animal in petsList:
        print("Animal!")


While a value is true:

    while countdown >= 0:
        print(countdown)
        countdown = countdown - 1

Note:
The number of times a loop should be run can be set in many different ways.

It could be set to run an exact number of times.

It could run once for every item in an array.

It could run as long as a certain boolean value is true.

There are many ways to use loops, but these are some of the more common approaches.
