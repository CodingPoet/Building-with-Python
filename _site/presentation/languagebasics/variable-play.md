### Try String Variables

Note:
Open up the file `01-string-variable.py` and take a look.

On the first line we can see a variable called `welcomeMessage` is being given the value `Hello world!`.

On the second line we can see the variable being passed to the print function. This is saying "Hey print function! Please print out the value stored in `welcomeMessage`".

Try changing the value of `welcomeMessage` and running the Python script again to see what happens.

Can you make the program print out "Welcome to 2014" by combining a text variable and a number variable?
