### Conditionals
_If this, then that_

Logical layout of code

	if this
		then that

Actual example of code

	if itIsRaining
		print("Use your umbrella!")

Note:
Conditionals are like switches which only turn on under certain circumstances.

They can basically be boiled down to pieces of code which represent an approach of "if this, then that".

In the example, `itIsRaining` is a variable, but it is not text or a number as we looked at previously.

The variable `itIsRaining` is what we call a "boolean". Boolean variables can only have a value of true or false.

Notice how the code describing the action to take is indented from the left edge. This signals to the computer that the indented piece of code is "inside" or "housed by" the line above it.

You can create that indent using the "tab" key on your keyboard.
