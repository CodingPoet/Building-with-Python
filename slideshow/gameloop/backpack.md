### Backpack

	self.backpack = Backpack()

Note:
In our adventureworld's init function, when we create the room, we also need to create a backpack.

If you take a look inside the backpack class, you'll see that it is a fairly simple object.

It contains an `items` array to hold the items, and a function for retrieving items by name.

Make sure to import the class!

Maybe this should actually be a dictionary...
