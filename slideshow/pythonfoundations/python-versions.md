### Python 3

_is the latest greatest Python_



Note:
There are many versions of Python available. Today we are using version 3 which is the latest version. 

Version 2.7 is often used too, and although there is not a huge amount of difference between them, it is important to be aware of. There are differences which could cause your program to be incompatible across versions.

Many Python educational books and websites still use Python 2.7, so keep an eye out for it!

Meanwhile, we'll launch into the future...
