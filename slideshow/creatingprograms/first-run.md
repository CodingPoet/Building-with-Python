### First Run

Welcome to my Adventure Game

You wake to find yourself in a dark, dirty alleyway. Night is falling. Your head hurts and you can't remember how you got here. 

Note:
So what happens when we run the program?

To run your program, you need to have the file `game.py` open, and then click the "run code" button.

You will need to do this every time you want to run your program.
