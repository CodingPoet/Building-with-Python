### Our Program

Note:
The Python program we will be building throughout this workshop will be a text-based game, run on the command line.

The player will need to navigate a series of rooms and find a key to unlock the door at the end of the game.

To create this program we will be using all of the concepts we looked at earlier, as well as classes and how to combine multiple python files into a single program.

By the end you will have your own complete and playable text-based game.
