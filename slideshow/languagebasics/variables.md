### Variables

`username = "pythongeek93"`

`topScore = 81000500`

Note:
First up, variables!

Variables are like named boxes where you can store information.

They can be used to store numbers, words, sentences, all sorts of things. They are usually used to store information which you would like to access from many different places in your program.

Good examples of variables you might like to create could be `score` which would be a number, or `username` which would be a word, or `reminderMessage` which would probably be a sentence.

When creating a variable in Python you need a name for the variable, and a sensible starting value.
