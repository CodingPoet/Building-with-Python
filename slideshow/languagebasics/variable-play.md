### Playing with Variables

Make the program to say hello to you by name!

Can you combine a string variable and a number variable <br>
to print out "Welcome to 2014"?

&nbsp;

_Pro Tip: to convert a number to a string, use_ 

`str(numberVariable)`

Note:
Open up `01-string-variable.py` and take a look.

On the first line we can see a variable called `welcomeMessage` is being given the value `Hello world!`.

On the second line we can see the variable being passed to the print function. This is saying "Hey print function! Please print out the value stored in `welcomeMessage`".

**Challenges:**

- Change the value of `welcomeMessage` to say hello to you by name.

- Make the program print out "Welcome to 2014" by combining a string variable and a number variable.
