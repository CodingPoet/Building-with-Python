### Play with Conditionals

Can you add support for a bronze trophy?

The award should be given if the player's score is over 600.


Note:
Open up `04-conditionals.py`

All conditional statements are made up of combinations of `if`, `elif` and `else`, in that order.

The word `elif` is short for "else if". In plain English, you might say it means "otherwise, if this other test is true...".

The tests `if` and `elif` both need boolean tests attached, to figure out whether the code they house should be run.

The `else` part of a conditional statement houses code which should only be run if none of the other tests work out to a value of true.

**Challenges:**

- Add support for a bronze trophy awarded when your score is over 600 points. You can change the value of `score` to test your code.
