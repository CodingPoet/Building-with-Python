## Slideshow Topics

### The Power of Python
Learn a bit about what Python is, what it is used for in the real world, and what we can gain from learning it. We talk about what we will be covering during the workshop, and where those skills could take you in the future if you continue to practice Python programming.

### Language Basics
We play with some code snippets to gain an understanding of the language, and to practice some of the skills we will use later in the day. Basic mathematics, strings, variables and loops.
